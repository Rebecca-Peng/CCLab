#Final Project
###It is an elastic band with an accelerometer and Arduino inside. As you can see there is a buckle because I want users put the sensors on the front of their waist to receive accurate data. I also used stick tape to allowed different users to adjust it. Then you can put it on and walk. This wearable tech may track your walking rhythm and control songs playing at your own rhythm.
